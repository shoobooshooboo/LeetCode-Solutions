# This repository is just my solutions for different leetcode problems. 

## NOTE: There are a bunch of comments on my code. I don't normally have this many comments when I code. I have just included these ones so whoever is looking at them can see what my thought process was when writing it. Most of this code should be pretty readable even without the comments.
